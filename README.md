# JESS 2019 Python setup tutorial

In the tutorials at the spring school you will work with the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org), one of the most versatile tools in modern science. These instructions help you with installing Python on your computer. As a fall-back option you can also access and run the tutorials online (see below).

## Install Python on your computer

A straight forward way to install Python on macOS, Windows or Linux is through the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/):

1. Download and install the _Python 3.7 version_ from their website: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
2. Open the [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/navigator/) and start the _JupyterLab_ app. In the browser window that opens you can now navigate your file system, create notebooks and run Python code.
3. Download the notebook `test-python-setup.ipynb` from this repository and place it in a directory that you can access in _JupyterLab_. Test your Python setup by following the first set of instructions in the notebook.

Note: If you already have experience with Python you can of course use a setup of your choice. We will work with both Python 2 and 3.

## Install LIGO packages

In our gravitational wave data analysis tutorials we will work with LIGO software that we are now going to install.

1. Follow the instructions in the [Anaconda documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/getting-started/) to create a new Python environment. Make sure to select Python 2.7 for the new environment. You can give it a name of your choice, e.g. `gw_data_analysis`.
2. Run the _JupyterLab_ app with the new environment activated. Open the `test-python-setup.ipynb` notebook again and follow the second set of instructions.

## Fall-back: Access online notebooks

As a fall-back option you can also access the tutorial notebooks online instead of installing Python on your computer. You will need to create a Microsoft account to log in to [Azure](https://notebooks.azure.com).
